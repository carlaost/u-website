 <h1>Refund &amp; Cancellation Policy</h1>
    
  <p>This policy explains how cancellations, refunds, and billing cycles work for our subscription plans. When you subscribe, your payment method is charged at the start of each billing cycle.</p>

  <h4>Cancellations</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>You may cancel your subscription at any time from your account settings or by 
        contacting our support team. After cancellation, you will retain access to your planâ€™s features until the 
        end of the current billing period. No further charges will be made once the 
        cancellation is processed.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Refunds</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>If you have <strong>not used</strong> our service since your last billing date, we will generally issue a refund for 
        your most recent charge. Beyond the above scenario, we typically do <strong>not</strong> provide refunds 
        once billing has occurred. If you feel there are special circumstances, please contact us at 
        <a href="mailto:support@undermind.ai">support@undermind.ai</a> for assistance. 
        We review such requests on a case-by-case basis.</li>
  </ul>
