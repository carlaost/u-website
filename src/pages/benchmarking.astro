We outline an end-to-end solution for searching academic literature. This system, Undermind,
uses language models as a reasoning engine and classifier at key steps within a structured search
process. We benchmark Undermind’s performance compared to Google Scholar, showing drastic
improvements including a 10× higher concentration of truly relevant results within the top hits.
Undermind misses virtually no highly relevant works found by Google Scholar, and in addition
returns 10× the total number of relevant results for the median user-generated query."
